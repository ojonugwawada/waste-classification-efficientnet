# 🧠 Waste Classification Using Deep Learning (EfficientNet-B0)

This project uses **EfficientNet-B0**, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to classify different types of waste. The aim is to assist automated systems in managing and sorting waste efficiently for environmental sustainability.

## 📌 Project Objective
To develop a deep learning model capable of classifying waste images into categories like recyclable, non-recyclable, organic, etc., thereby promoting cleaner environments and supporting smart agricultural systems.

## 💡 Relevance to AgriTech
Waste management is crucial to rural and agricultural ecosystems. This model can be integrated into smart agri-waste systems to:
- Automate compostable waste segregation
- Enhance precision waste handling in rural farms
- Improve sustainability in agri-supply chains

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- EfficientNet-B0
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib

## 🗂️ Files Included
- `Waste_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning_(EfficientNet_B0).ipynb`: Main notebook
- `Waste Classification Using Deep Learning (EfficientNet-B0).pdf`: Final project report

## 📊 Model Performance
- Training and validation accuracy metrics show strong performance
- Early stopping and data augmentation applied to avoid overfitting

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Follow the code to understand data preprocessing, model setup, and evaluation
3. Replace the dataset path with your own local or Google Drive path if needed

## 🤝 Contribution
This project is part of a growing portfolio exploring how **AI and Deep Learning** can support **Agritech and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.
